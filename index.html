      <p>USM-eM is a new competitive mod for Smash 3DS and Wii U, inspired by Project M and Melee.  Changes include <b>character and gameplay changes that match Melee closely</b>, as well as a handful of extras like <b>Stages, SFX and Music, Skins, and more!</b> Every single character will have balance changes eventually to make them more tournament viable, but currently every character is affected by global changes such as <b>increased gravity, altered ledge mechanics, dash dancing, and more</b> but only a few characters have been changed completely.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Q: What do I need to play USM-eM?</strong><br>
          A: All you need is a 3DS with Luma3DS CFW or a Wii U and a copy of Smash!<br>
          <strong>Q: Why do I need CFW? Couldn’t I just play this mod from the Homebrew Launcher?</strong><br>
          A: Smash packs its files in a very strange way: into 2 massive files called DT and LS. We simply need to implement a repacking tool for end-users to patch their game individually. This is too much effort for the majority of people. <a href="https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/SaltySD">ShinyQuagsire23’s SaltySD</a> bypasses this entirely by hijacking Smash’s code to redirect file reading to the SaltySD folder on the SD card. It uses Luma’s support of <a href="https://yifan.lu/2016/03/28/3ds-code-injection-through-loader/">Yifan Lu's "loader"</a> to implement this, which is why Luma is required for now.<br>
          <strong>Q: OK, when can we expect a HBL version?</strong><br>
          A: Is possible <a href="http://opensa.dantarion.com/wiki/DT-LS_Filesystem">right now</a>. It could happen eventually, although we’d suggest <a href="3ds.guide">getting Luma</a> as it's unlikely to happen for a while.<br>
          <strong>Q: Wait, I’m on a different CFW, like rxTools or ReiNAND! Can I still use this mod?</strong><br>
          A: Technically, you can use this mod with any CFW that supports Yifan Lu's loader to implement SaltySD through code modifications. While some other CFWs do support it, Luma is easily the most simplistic CFW that includes this feature.<br>
          <strong>Q: How do you guys do this tech wizardry?</strong><br>
          A: All kinds of tools and tricks and hacks! If you’re interested, Yudowat has composed guides on <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/smash3ds-updated-rom-hacking-guide.439533/">general Smash 3DS hacking</a> and <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/a-guide-to-sm4shcommand.447717/">basic moveset editing</a>.<br>
